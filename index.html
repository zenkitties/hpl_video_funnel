              <h3>At Last, The Secret To Consistent Power Is Revealed...</h3>
              <h4>Through Human Movement "Rules", Validated by Science, that are Applied to Hitting a 
Ball</h4>

                    <p>It’s no secret. Trying to dramatically increase power without sacrificing swing quality is 
                    extremely difficult.  As you struggle to overcome the issue, you’re often met with 
                    headaches and closed doors. Finding a resolution seems impossible.
                    </p>
                    <p>You have:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i>Read, watched, and/or listened to every hitting program imaginable, which ended up in 
                        paralysis by analysis,</li>
                        <li><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i>Hired local or online hitting instructors, which only resulted in hitters not being able 
                        to translate the performance of a grooved cage swing into game at-bats,</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>...and oh yeah, you probably have even...</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i>Tried following drills and FREE instruction on YouTube, which led to chasing "methods" that have NO real connection to human movement “rules”, that are validated by science.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It’s really no wonder that most people who try to dramatically increase power without 
                    sacrificing swing quality give up.</p>
                    <p>But the truth is...</p>
                    <p>Finally being able to turn 100-pound hitters into consistent 300-foot ball crushing 
                    machines is much closer than you think...</p>

                      <p>"Just want to say thank you. My son who is 14, 5'6" and maybe 120lbs is really benefiting 
from your drills. We modified his batting swing during this past off-season, per your 
instructions, and have definitely seen the power go up. He is a lefty that used to hit a 
lot of singles to opposite field. Now we are seeing, doubles, triples, and 2 HR's so far 
early in our season...to right field. He was never a pull hitter, but now is able to go 
that way with power while still going to left with a pitch. Thanks! Greg"</p>

                      <p>"Hey coach, even with Mia still hitting with her hands near hear head, Mia in a 3 game 
span, hit 3 home runs over the fence and a stand up double, three singles and four walks. 
Only made one out, a shot down first.  She never had a series of games like this an 
especially playing with girls that are this much older.  Mia is able to play in 12 and 
under, but she is playing in the high school division.  Our sights are getting ready for 
October 4 and 5. That is when we go to the U of Florida camp. Their assistant coach has 
called Mia's coach twice in the past week and wants us to call him this week.  Let keep 
on coarse and work hard, thanks so much for all your help coach."</p>

anything practical. What you've put together is very impressive. Most of what I've come 
across, even from those in the profession that understand human movement are assessment 
methods and tools to analyze movement and posture only to sell a few methods to correct 
dysfunction issues. Few are willing or able to explain human movement the way you have. 
These principles are the key for both performance and injury management. I appreciate the 
time and effort you put in to help those looking to perfect their craft and for those of 
us out their trying to help them."</p>

                   <p id="the_fine_print">*The "fine print": Please don't take these case studies as an even remotely typical result. The hitters I mention didn't dive into my online video courses, they were private local or online clients.They also worked like crazy, and kept on trying even after hitting major obstacles as most baseball or softball hitters on the journey do. Most 12u hitters don't do this. They just show up for a lesson (if local) or gather info. and "get ready" to work...or they throw in the towel and quit at the first bump in the road. It took these hitters a lot of hard work to start seeing favorable hitting outcomes.</p>
